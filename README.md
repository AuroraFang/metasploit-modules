# MOF Persistence

This is a modified version of https://github.com/khr0x40sh/metasploit-modules

Thanks khr0x40sh!

A simple persistence script to mimic the functionality of the default persistence meterpreter module, but by accomplishing such via Managed Object Files and powershell. May require administrative privileges to execute. To use, just simply copy this module to $msf_path/modules/post/windows/.
 
- Can do persistence with any type of files. Works very nice with .bat files with powershell payloads.

# More modules comming soon
